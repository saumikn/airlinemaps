# Airline Maps

 Saumik Narayanan

## Description

Most airline route maps which exist online are very difficult to understand and parse, because all of the lines on the map are the same color and its nearly impossible to tell where the lines are coming from and going. Insert citations.

This repository allows you to visualize the routes much more understandably, by color-coding the flight paths based on the base hub of the flight. For instance, in the below image of Delta Airline's domestic routes, all the routes that start in Atlanta are shown in red, all Minneapolis routes are pink, all Seattle routes are dark blue, etc. Any routes

I have also provided code which can display these maps interactively, allowing the user to filter routes based out of a single airline.
